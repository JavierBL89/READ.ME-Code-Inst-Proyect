   # User Experience Design, UXD

   In order to structure the website we need first to know how we're gonna do it by knowing who is the product addressed for since the desing and content vary.

   The goal of user experience design is to make sure that users emocional experience is positive by making the site simple, intuitive and ejoyable and all of that is approched throught simplifying 5 planes:

    1. Strategy. 
       - Focus on what is worth doing.
    2. Scope.
       - Content and features 
    3. Structure.
       - Designing interaction to the user
       - Prioriting content
    4. Skeleton.
      - Designing visual presentation of elements
      - Intuitive Navigation
    5. Surface.
      - Colors, typography, effects imagery
      - Guide the user to what is worth


PD: Right at the end of the very first lesson of the UX Module which introduces you to UX Design, after a quick quiz comes up a page out of no where to submit your proyect, but what project are we supposed to submit?? is says nothing!! it does not makes any sense!!

Only 2 days ago after finishing the UX module, i got an email saying that i have to submit a READ.ME proyect, so i gathered that the page that came up out of nowhere(the one i'm using to submit this file) to submit a proyect must be the one for the READ.ME proyect

Yep this is a complain about lack of clarifycation on that part of the course program.
